To do list:

1. Documentation catch up
2. Separate functions into better files
3. Allow main to be a function and take in a parameter about whether to send the output file or not
4. Make template matching faster so that all templates are the same size (with reasonable proporions) so that I only
 have to resize my original image once
5. Update Hough circle transform so that it finds the right number of noteheads
       (while not right, change parameters for each image)
6. Update barred notes so that they are split into separate components (easier to deal with)
     - do vertical projection to find all stems
     - separate in the middle x position of each stem
     - Run noteheads on each component and add them in (could be chords
     - Put bar in dictionary/object attributes so they are connected on muse score
     - Find duration of each piece, by finding how many bars above each note head
7. Make sure to throw out all notes that are impossible (no staff, no noteheads, etc.)
8. Find more music to work with with other types of notes
9. Remove all other black pixels that are not part of the connected component, but are close enough they are in the image
10. Update generateXML so that I can change the attributes based on what I read music wise
    - Will also need to fix what segmentationAndRecognition returns then
