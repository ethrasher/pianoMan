To do list:

1. Documentation catch up!
2. Make template matching faster so that all templates are the same size (with reasonable proporions) so that I only
 have to resize my original image once
3. Update Hough circle transform so that it finds the right number of noteheads
       (while not right, change parameters for each image) - Done (I think)
4. Update barred notes so that they are split into separate components (easier to deal with)
     - do vertical projection to find all stems
     - separate in the middle x position of each stem
     - Run noteheads on each component and add them in (could be chords
     - Put bar in dictionary/object attributes so they are connected on muse score
     - Find duration of each piece, by finding how many bars above each note head
5. Make sure to throw out all notes that are impossible (no staff, no noteheads, etc.)
6. Find more music to work with with other types of notes
7. Remove all other black pixels that are not part of the connected component, but are close enough they are in the image
8. Gui interface where client can choose to use their product
    -Somewhere to specify path of song they want to work on
    -Somewhere to organize any notes it could not recognize (no template match)
    -Some kind of waiting/spiral to show it is working on something
9. Unit testing!


Things to still do:
1. Documentation catch up!
2. Get barred notes to actually end up barred on soundslice
3. Find correct duration of barred notes (currently just putting eighth) using vertical projection
4. Make sure that it is finding those barred notes correctly (seemed to be splitting a few too many times for some of the notes in HB
5. Remove all other black pixels that are not part of the connected component, but are close enough they are in the bounding box
6. Gui interface where a user can fix notes that were unidentifiable
7. Make template matching faster
